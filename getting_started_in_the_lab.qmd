# Getting Started in the Lab {.unnumbered}

Welcome aboard! ðŸš€ The first step is getting connectedâ€”both with people and platforms. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll need to set up so you can communicate, collaborate, and keep projects moving:

1. **Microsoft Teams** â€“ Our virtual lab lounge. This is where we chat, share ideas, and post updates. Start here for quick questions or discussions.

2. **GitHub** â€“ Think of this as your digital lab notebook. Itâ€™s where we keep code, papers, grants, and more. Every commit is a record of your contributionâ€”so push often and stay credited!

3. **Microsoft Planner** â€“ Our project dashboard. Using Kanban boards, we track tasks from brainstorming all the way to publication. Itâ€™s how we see progress, bottlenecks, and priorities at a glance.

:::{.callout-note title=Task}
As a OSU student you already have access to `**Microsoft Teams**` and `**Planner**`, all you have to do is create `**GitHub**` account.
:::

Once youâ€™re set up, hop into **Teams** to introduce yourself (#general is a good place) and start the onboarding workflow. Depending on your role, you may see just one project channel or the full lab space.

Once youâ€™ve created those accounts, you can ask any questions through `Microsoft Teams` (use the #general channel or the channel specific your project). Depending on your role in the lab, you may be added on `Microsoft Teams` as a single-channel guest (access to only one channel) or a in the #general channel through the Workflows menu (usually near the top left of the window). Once you initiate the workflow, youâ€™ll be guided through the onboarding process.

## Lab website {#sec-labwebsite}
Once you have your accounts set up, youâ€™ll need to add your profile to the labâ€™s website. Follow these steps to fork the repository, create your profile folder, and add your details.

### Step 1: Fork the Lab Website Repository

1. Go to the [lab website GitHub repository](https://github.com/iHuman-Lab/lab-website){target='_blank_'}.
2. Click on the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository

1. On your GitHub account, navigate to your forked repository.
2. Click the **Code** button and copy the repository URL.
3. Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iHuman-Lab/lab-website.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd lab-website
   ```

### Step 3: Add Your Profile Folder

1. In the `people` directory, find the folder corresponding to your role in the lab:

   ```{.bash}
   people/
   â”œâ”€â”€ pi/
   â”œâ”€â”€ phd/
   â”œâ”€â”€ master/
   â”œâ”€â”€ undergraduate/
   â””â”€â”€ alumni/
   ```

2. If you are a `master` student, create a new folder with your name under the `master` directory. Replace `"your_name"` with your actual name:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p people/master/"your_name"
   ```

   For other roles, replace `master` with `pi`, `phd`, `undergraduate`, or `alumni` accordingly.

### Step 4: Add Your Profile Details

1. Inside your folder (e.g., `people/master/"your_name"`), add your profile photo and index file.

2. Your photo should be named `avatar.jpg`. Add this photo to your folder:
   ```bash
   cp path/to/your/photo.jpg people/master/"your_name"/avatar.jpg
   ```

3. Create an `index.qmd` file in the same folder. Use the following content template for `index.qmd`:

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: Your name here
   about:
       template: trestles
       links:
           - icon: linkedin
             text: LinkedIn
             url: Add your linkedin link
           - icon: github
             text: Github
             url: Add your Github link
           - text: "{{< ai google-scholar >}} Google Scholar"
             url: If you have google scholar link, add it here.
           - text: Website
             url: If you have a website link, add it here.
   image: ./avatar.jpg
   ---

   ## Education
   Fill your education history here

   ## Research Interest
   Provide your research interest
   ```

   Replace placeholders like `Your name here`, `Add your linkedin link`, etc., with your actual details.

### Step 5: Commit and Push Your Changes

1. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add profile for [Your Name]"
   ```

2. Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 6: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Pull Requests** tab and then **New Pull Request**.
3. Select the base repository as `iHuman-Lab/lab-website` and compare it with your forked repository.
4. Add a description for your pull request and submit it.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratsâ€”youâ€™re officially part of the lab online! If you get stuck, just ping Hemanth on Teams.
