All lab members are welcome (and encouraged!) to submit edits that improve the content, clarity, and overall helpfulness of this document at any point throughout their tenure in the lab. What should you do if you don’t understand something? If you don’t understand something you read in this manual, it is important that you ask another lab member for help. Every member of the lab brings their own unique knowledge base, training, life experiences, and perspectives. Respecting and celebrating those differences drives the science we do. If you’re new to the lab or new to a particular technique, you might feel like a newbie today—but chances are good that if you stick around for a bit, someone else will be seeking your expert opinion before you know it. In addition to learning, there’s another good reason for asking for help: if you don’t understand something, there’s a reasonable chance that you’ve discovered a mistake or a logical inconsistency!",

It also means that our fellow lab members are achieving their training and career objectives. To achieve peak efficiency, we need to succeed on three fronts:\n\nCommunication. We want to foster an environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing to the collective dialogue. Our lab meets regularly to discuss logistical (e.g. scheduling, financial, sociological) and technical issues. We also use a variety of software packages to synchronize and facilitate communication within our lab and between our lab and the broader scientific community.\nResource allocation. Our lab resources (e.g. equipment, time, money, attention) are finite. We want to foster an environment where lab resources are used as efficiently as possible to achieve our collective goals. We also want to foster sustainable use of resources by regularly pursuing research funding opportunities.\nAdaptability. The whole point of research is that we don’t already know the answers to the questions we’re exploring or how to create the tools we’re working on. That means that we won’t necessarily be able to plan out everything in advance. We often need to be focused and efficient without knowing the end goal!\n\nYour job as a contributing lab member is to help us to achieve our collective peak efficiency (as a lab) while also maximizing your own training and career potential.

It provides an interface for asking questions, storing notes, and sharing ideas. If you have a Dartmouth College NetID you should be able to join the workspace by clicking the link.

In other words, anything where it’d be useful to track multiple versions, anything that we might ultimately want to release to the public, and/or anything that multiple lab members will be collaborating on. Each project has one or more `GitHub` repositories. You should treat `GitHub` as a digital version of a “lab notebook” that contains a formal record of every contribution you make to your projects. We use `GitHub` logs to assign credit for ideas, code or writing contributions, determine authorship order, and more. It is therefore critical that you regularly check in (commit) your work via `GitHub` so that you receive appropriate credit for your ideas and maintain a continuous traceable log for your project.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The work we do is complicated, and mistakes happen. When you notice a mistake (a bug, misinterpretation, mislabeling, or any other error), it is critical that you report the mistake immediately. Whereas mistakes are unavoidable in science, negative impacts can be minimized by fostering a workplace where reporting mistakes is celebrated and accepted as part of the natural course of getting things done. Mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow, and identifying or noticing mistakes should be celebrated as part of our growth as researchers. However, real harm can come from failing to report mistakes soon enough. There is a proverb that says the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago; the second best time is now. Analogously, the best time to identify and correct a mistake may have been in the past– but the second best time is right now!\nExample scenarios (not an exhaustive list):\n\nYou’ve shared a figure, statistic, or other result, and you’ve realized there’s a bug in your code.\nYou tried to collect some data and the experiment crashed or yielded corrupted data.\nYou’re re-reading a paper that you shared, and you notice a mistake or typo.\nYou made a plan with your project team and you realized it’s flawed in some way, or that there’s potentially a better solution or approach.\nYou released a software package and you’ve found a bug or error.\n\nAppropriate actions for each of the above scenarios (this should happen immediately after you notice the mistake):\n\nVerify: Double-check to confirm the mistake. Review your code, re-run experiments if necessary, or revisit reference materials.\nReport: Create a GitHub issue detailing the problem. Include information on how to replicate the issue, expected versus observed behavior, and any relevant system details like operating environment and software versions.\nCollaborate: Use Slack or other communication channels to discuss the issue with your project team. Collaborate to understand the root cause and formulate an effective plan of action.\nSeek guidance: If unsure, reach out to colleagues for assistance. Utilize resources like Google or Stack Exchange to explore potential solutions.\n\nRemember, consulting with others when in doubt is always a wise move. Every mistake is an opportunity for growth and improvement, contributing to our collective journey as researchers. Let’s continue fostering an environment where learning from mistakes is celebrated and supported, ensuring that our work maintains its highest standards of quality and reliability.",

    "text": "Our lab has largely been operating in a hybrid mode of work (i.e., partially remote and partially in-person), and in recent years our meeting schedule and requirements have reflected this reality. Moving forward, we are now gradually starting to incorporate more in-person interactions and meetings to facilitate more spontaneous interactions, discussions, and collaborations.\nEffective lab communication requires forums for communicating. We use Slack to facilitate non-in-person communications. We also encourage in-person interactions as often as possible—ideally several times a week for group projects.\nWe’ll have the following regularly scheduled meetings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nLab meetings. Starting in the fall, 2024 term to be held on Tuesdays from 1:30 - 2:30 PM (CST) in our main lab space.\n\n\nIf you are an active lab member, you are expected to attend our lab meetings unless you let Hemanth know that you have a conflict (e.g., a course that meets at the same time, another commitment that comes up, etc.). It is important to prioritize lab meeting attendance so that we can build and maintain a lab culture of collaboration and ongoing participation.\nYou are also expected to present at one lab meeting per term. Possible presentation topics include (but are not limited to):\n\nA half-baked idea you have\nAn interesting paper you read\nAn interesting tool or software package you learned about\nA tutorial\nA (brief) hackathon\nSomething you’re confused about that you want help from other lab members\nA practice presentation (poster, talk, etc.) you’d like feedback on\nLead a discussion about some topic you think would be of interest to the group\n\nYou can take up to an hour for your presentation or discussion, although taking less than an hour is great too. You can also share a meeting slot with one or more other lab members if you wish. (A presentation with another lab member can still “count” as a presentation for the given term.) Hemanth will send out a Google Sheets link where you can add yourself to the meeting schedule at the start of each term.\n\nProject meetings. Several of our collaborative projects involve regular coordination within the lab and/or with external lab members. These are organized on an ad-hoc basis for each project. Attendees: all project team members and any other interested active lab members.\nHackathons. We occasionally organize hackathon style events whereby spontaneously organized groups work towards one or more very short term projects or goals. These are scheduled on an ad hoc basis. Attendees: all interested lab members, any interested member of the Dartmouth community, and external collaborators.\nWeekly snippets.

    "text": "Our lab’s practices and policies are intended to provide a framework for maximizing efficiency. Achieving our peak efficiency as a lab means we are being as scientifically productive as possible, in terms of knowledge discovery (learning new stuff) and dissemination (papers, talks, conference presentations, publicly released datasets, software, etc.). It also means that our fellow lab members are achieving their training and career objectives. To achieve peak efficiency, we follow these principles:\n\nCollaboration: Our lab benefits greatly by being an intellectually diverse team. We bring in expertise from many disciplines, e.g., Computer Science, Neuroscience, Biomedical Engineering. No one in the lab (including myself) has the background necessary to tackle all the problems we’re trying to solve. Therefore, the only way we can be successful is by fostering an openly collaborative and communicative environment. Ultimately, our group strongly selects for team members who are comfortable admitting what they don’t know and learning new material as they go (both through independent research and discussion with colleagues).\nPatience: As mentioned above - if we already knew the answer, we would not be studying the question. Similarly, if the work was easy, usually someone else would’ve done it already. From that standpoint, we fundamentally expect our experiments and approaches to fail more often than they succeed. So while we’re always shooting for success, it’s important to have thick skin and not get overly frustrated when things aren’t working out. Just keep working diligently, keep thinking through the problem, and keep discussing it with your colleagues. It’s also important to continually make honest evaluations on whether a problem is worth pushing on further, or when it’s worth cutting our losses and moving on.\nAccept the process: Don’t hide or be afraid of contradictory results, mistakes, bugs, etc. We’re going to make mistakes, and we’ll find plenty of results that challenge our hypotheses, or that we don’t initially know how to explain. So even if something is intimidating or embarassing, the only way forward is to face it head-on and openly, figure out solutions, and move on.\nCaution: Science is about being extremely careful and thorough. Double and triple check every result. Be extremely skeptical about results, and think through every way they could be wrong before concluding that they’re correct. Ask others to look at your results and think of ways they might be wrong. If we apply extremely high standards internally, then our work will easily pass external review.\nAttention to detail: Our studies often involve complex systems and processes, with many points of failure that could doom an entire experiment or analysis. So careful attention to detail and quality control are crucial for making sure things keep moving forward.\nCommunication: Technical skills are important, but equally (if not more important) are communication skills. No one in our lab works in isolation (see first item above!) - at a minimum, you communicate frequently with your PI (me), and likely work closely with other lab members and collaborators. So without sustained effort from everyone to communicate, it’s easy for things to go off track, for there to be misunderstandings or duplicated efforts, etc.\nFeedback: We want everyone in the lab to be comfortable giving and receiving direct, constructive criticism and feedback. It’s extremely challenging to open up your thoughts and ideas to criticism, for fear that people will judge you personally. But if everyone is comfortable giving and receiving feedback that is never personal, it opens us up to different perspectives. Often this will reveal flaws in ideas that are hard to see when you’re too close to them, and new solutions. Similarly, it’s easy to get too attached to ideas because they’re your own - we all have an instinct to go prove our ideas and show how clever we are. In our lab environment, that’s not the goal! There’s no “extra credit” for doing things on your own. It’s much more important to find ways to solve the problem and discover truth, and the folks around you are wonderful resources to make that happen.\nPositivity: Everyone on our team is working on a challenging set of problems. Being positive and supportive makes the endeavor more enjoyable for everyone. If you run into issues where it’s difficult to be positive and supportive with your colleagues, take a break and come talk to me, we’ll work something out.\nBalance: Don’t try to work 24/7, if for no other reason than you’ll just find yourself staring at a screen without doing anything productive. Work smarter - I find it helpful to create focused blocks where I eliminate distractions. However you do it, make sure you take breaks to refresh your mind, and have a life outside of lab. There are obvious benefits for your mental health, but you’ll also find yourself refreshed and productive when you do get back to work.\nResource allocation: Our lab resources (e.g. equipment, time, money, attention) are finite. We want to foster an environment where lab resources are used as efficiently as possible to achieve our collective goals. We also want to foster sustainable use of resources by regularly pursuing research funding opportunities.\n\nYour job as a contributing lab member is to help us to achieve our collective peak efficiency (as a lab) while also maximizing your own training and career potential.",

This is related to replicability, in that it has to do with your ability to get the same results again, but it refers specifically to getting the same results given the ​same set of data.​ I expect that all of our research will be, at minimum, reproducible (I hope that it will also be replicable).\nConducting reproducible research is more difficult than it sounds, because it requires that you are organized and possess sufficient foresight to document each step of your research process. There are three main things you can do to improve the reproducibility of your research: 1) extensive note-taking (i.e., as much as you can manage), 2) programming workflows with version control, and 3) extensive testing of code base and cross validation.\nProgramming workflows help with reproducibility because they take some of the human element out, and in an ideal scenario, you are left with a script or series of scripts that takes data from raw form to final product. Programming alone is not enough, though, because people can easily forget which script changes they made and when. Therefore, all projects that involve programming of any kind (so basically, all projects) must use some form of version control. I strongly recommend git in combination with GitHub, unless you have a pre-existing workflow. This is a hard requirement because\n\nit is the only way to definitively track the evolution of methods/files over time\nit allows for easier detection of bugs\nit facilitates code sharing\nit has nice side effects for workflow organization (e.g., thinking in terms of commits, branches, issues).\n\nPoints a, b, and c are directly relevant to the mission of conducting reproducible research.",

This is an absolute requirement. ​Lab members must also complete the CITI training and be added to the research personnel list before they can work with human subjects. If there are any questions about the protocols, or if you’re not sure whether we have IRB approval to run your study, please ask the lab manager or me for clarification. If necessary, the lab manager or me can file an amendment to an existing protocol or create a new protocol.\n\nCreate an account on CITI’s website. If you are a Oklahoma State University student or employee, choose Oklahoma State University as your organization affiliation and use your@okstate.edu email address to create your account. Oklahoma State University will cover your registration fee.\nContinue the registration process until you reach step 7. Select Human Subjects Research. Then select Group 2: Social/Behavioral Basic Course as your registration course. If you also need to complete the biomedical module, you will be able to add it after completing the social/behavioral module.\nThere are 16 required modules that need to be completed. Read/watch the material and complete the quiz at the end of each module. You will need to achieve a score of at least an 80% to pass. Quizzes may be reviewed and retaken.\n\nOnce you have finished the training module, send your Completion Certificate to Hemanth. To access your certificate:\n\nSign into your CITI account and select Records at the top of your home page.\nSelect View-Print-Share under Completion Record.\nUnder Completion Certificate, select View/Print. You do not need to share your Completion Report.\nDownload the PDF and send it to ihuman.research.lab@gmail.com\n\nWhen you run an experimental participant, you must have them sign a consent form. After each day of testing (or more frequently), you should give all signed consent forms to Hemanth by emailing them to ihuman.research.lab@gmail.com. Consent forms are kept in a locked file cabinet in Hemanth’s office. All experimental data must be stored securely, as per IRB guidelines. All lab computers employ disk encryption and password protection. If you need to copy unpublished data onto a non-lab computer, you need to verify (by checking in with Hemanth) that your computer satisfies our data security requirements. No personally identifiable data about our participants may ever be shared outside of the lab.\nIf you encounter any problems in the course of doing research that results in a negative outcome for the participant (e.g., if a participant becomes ill or upset, if there is an accident with the equipment, if there is a breach of confidentiality, etc), you should immediately seek assistance from me or the lab manager. If I am not around, ​you must notify me w​ithin 24 hours​, preferably as soon as possible. In some cases, we may need to report this information to the IRB and/or our funding agencies.",

In other words, anything where it’d be useful to track multiple versions, anything that we might ultimately want to release to the public, and/or anything that multiple lab members will be collaborating on. Each project has one or more `GitHub` repositories. You should treat `GitHub` as a digital version of a “lab notebook” that contains a formal record of every contribution you make to your projects. We use `GitHub` logs to assign credit for ideas, code or writing contributions, determine authorship order, and more.

    "text": "A major component of doing scientific research is communicating with other researchers. The iHuman Lab regularly presents at several international scientific conferences. If you are presenting your work from the lab (i.e., you are the presenting author for a talk or poster), then your travel expenses and conference registration fees will be guaranteed by the lab, under the assumption that you will also make reasonable efforts to seek out alternative sources of travel funding (e.g. through PBS, other internal Dartmouth sources, applying for travel awards, using personal grants like NRSAs or NSF fellowships, etc.). You are also expected to keep costs low (e.g. fly economy class, seek out cheaper tickets, stay in reasonably priced hotels, share a room with other lab members, etc.). By the same token, we also want to be cognizant of your comfort and time, and it is not always necessary to use the cheapest option. More specific travel guidelines will be given on a per-conference or per-trip basis.\nIf you are not presenting your work (or if you’re presenting non-lab work), but you are a senior lab member, then the lab may cover your travel expenses to a limited number of conferences each year. These should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with Hemanth.\nIf you are a junior lab member not presenting your work, the lab will generally not pay for you to attend conferences. However, if you are interested in attending a conference, and you aren’t able to secure funding through non-lab sources, you should discuss your options with Hemanth.",

    "text": "The very first thing you need to do is to get set up on the following platforms, which will enable you to interact with the rest of the lab, download and use the lab’s software packages, and accomplish various necessary administrative tasks:\n\nSlack: This is where almost all not-in-person lab communications take place. It provides an interface for asking questions, storing notes, and sharing ideas. If you have a Dartmouth College NetID you should be able to join the workspace by clicking the link. If you do not have a NetID, you’ll need to request one here. Here are some tutorials to get started with Slack:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub: This is used to manage all code, papers, grants, presentations, and posters. In other words, anything where it’d be useful to track multiple versions, anything that we might ultimately want to release to the public, and/or anything that multiple lab members will be collaborating on. Each project has one or more GitHub repositories. You should treat GitHub as a digital version of a “lab notebook” that contains a formal record of every contribution you make to your projects. We use GitHub logs to assign credit for ideas, code or writing contributions, determine authorship order, and more. It is therefore critical that you regularly check in (commit) your work via GitHub so that you receive appropriate credit for your ideas and maintain a continuous traceable log for your project. Here are some tutorials to get started with GitHub:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClickUp: This serves as our essential management tool for meticulously tracking project progress and priorities. Leveraging the Kanban method extensively, we visualize our workflows dynamically. This allows us to categorize tasks into clear stages, from planning and experimentation to analysis and publication. By visualizing our project in this manner, we can easily identify bottlenecks, prioritize tasks, and decide which parts of the project to focus on at any given time. Here are some tutorials to get started with ClickUp:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nCreate (free) ClickUp, Slack, and GitHub accounts. Also initiate a request to join our Slack workspace via this link.\n\n\nOnce you’ve created those accounts, you can ask any questions through Slack (use the #general channel or the channel specific your project). Depending on your role in the lab, you may be added on Slack as a single-channel guest (access to only one channel) or a in the #general channel through the Workflows menu (usually near the top left of the window). Once you initiate the workflow, you’ll be guided through the onboarding process.",

Providing Hemanth with at least two weeks ensures he can dedicate the necessary attention to detail.\nWhen collaborating on research and teaching statements, a minimum of three weeks allows for productive discussions and ensures the final product reflects thorough consideration and expertise.\nFor manuscripts, pivotal to academic contributions, share drafts as soon as they’re ready.

    "text": "In my experience, one of the strongest predictors of whether people will do well in the lab is their ability to communicate effectively, both with me and with others. Often there are two key barriers:\n\nSometimes people worry that if they communicate questions or struggles, they will be seen as somehow inferior for not knowing something. In fact, that’s rarely the case, and the opposite is a much bigger concern! People who don’t communicate often get hung up on specific issues (that may be very challenging, and could really use outside perspective/discussion). Ultimately this leads to someone being much less productive than the person who’s willing to ask questions. On the other hand, I’ve never once worried about somebody not knowing something - everyone in the lab is around because we believe in their talents. So the right decision is most often to just speak up! Try to overcome your imposter syndrome, and focus on working with your colleagues (me, other lab members) to find a solution to the problem.\nA second issue is that we’re often afraid of “bothering” more senior people (undergrads worry about bothering grad students, grad students worry about bothering postdocs, everybody worries about bothering the PI, etc). I feel the same way about potentially bothering my own mentors and supervisors! Fight that instinct. Bottom line - I much prefer that people in the lab speak up, and I have no problem telling people if they are in fact bothering me (so far, this has never happened). If these are sources of anxiety, I totally get it. However, if it’s possible to overcome them, your time in lab will end up being much easier, and likely your productivity will increase quite a bit!\n\nIf these are sources of anxiety, I totally get it. However, if it’s possible to overcome them, your time in lab will end up being much easier, and likely your productivity will increase quite a bit!\nIn general, I do not expect you feel the need to respond to things on weekends or after hours. I do sometimes send emails or Slack messages during those times - that’s just because I get to stuff when I get to it. Don’t feel pressured to respond until you’re back to work yourself! I only expect you to be responsive after hours during specific critical time periods (e.g., right before a submission deadline or leading up to a conference presentation). We should be able to anticipate those cases and agree upon a strategy in advance. If there’s anything distressing about off-hours messages, just let me know, and I’ll try not to bother you during those times.",
