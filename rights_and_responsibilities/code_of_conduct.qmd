# Code of Conduct {.unnumbered}

At iHuman Lab, we believe in fostering an environment where everyone feels respected, supported, and safe. Here's our code of conduct:

## The Quick Version

* We are committed to creating a **harassment-free space** for all lab members and visitors, regardless of gender, age, race, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, or religion.
* **Harassment is not tolerated** in any formâ€”whether verbal, physical, or emotional.
* **Sexual language and imagery** are inappropriate in all lab spaces, including meetings, presentations, or casual conversations.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes:

* **Offensive comments** related to gender, age, appearance, race, religion, etc.
* **Sexual images or language** in public spaces.
* **Intimidation, stalking, and unwelcome attention** (verbal or physical).
* **Disruptions** during talks, meetings, or events.
* **Inappropriate contact** or unwanted physical behavior.

If asked to stop any harassing behavior, **you must comply immediately.**

If you're experiencing or witnessing harassmentâ€”or have any concernsâ€”please contact **Hemanth** right away. If Hemanth is the issue, reach out to the **department chair** or another trusted staff member.

## The Bottom Line

We expect all members to uphold these guidelines at **all lab-related events**. Letâ€™s work together to keep our environment safe, welcoming, and productive!
