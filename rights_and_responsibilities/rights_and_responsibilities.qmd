# Rights and Responsibilities

As a member of iHuman Lab, you have certain **rights**—and you also have important **responsibilities**. Here’s the rundown:

## **Your Rights as a Lab Member**

1. You’re entitled to a **safe and respectful** work environment—no harassment, abuse, violence, or discrimination.
2. You’re entitled to be **supported and respected** by all lab members.
3. You’re entitled to **freely share** your scientific ideas and offer constructive feedback.
4. You’re entitled to receive **appropriate credit** (authorship, acknowledgments, recommendations) for your contributions.

## **Your Responsibilities as a Lab Member**

1. **Promote a safe environment**: Avoid any behavior that could harm, harass, or discriminate against others.
2. **Support and respect** everyone, including yourself.
3. **Share your ideas and feedback** openly with fellow lab members.
4. **Document your contributions** clearly: Whether it’s via `GitHub`, reports, or updates on `Microsoft Teams`, make sure your work is tracked.
5. **Communicate openly**: Address concerns directly with those involved, and always be clear with others about your work.
6. **Work with integrity**: Commit to high scientific standards in everything you do.
7. **Use resources responsibly**: Whether it’s time, equipment, or funding, make sure you're being sustainable and considerate.
8. **Keep your space clean**: A tidy lab is a happy lab—clean up after yourself and maintain shared areas too!

## **Big Picture**

* **Do work you’re proud of**—and work that others will care about.
* **Double-check your work**: Good science requires a little obsession with detail.
* **Support your labmates**: We’re a team, and teamwork makes the dream work.
* **Be independent when you can**: But never hesitate to ask for help when you need it.
* **Share your knowledge**: Mentorship comes in many forms.
* **Respect diversity**: Honor each other’s strengths, weaknesses, and beliefs.
* **Take care of yourself**: Science is a marathon. Take time off when needed, and respect others' personal time.
* **Communicate openly**: Be transparent and respectful in all interactions.
* **Talk to Hemanth** if you have an unresolved issue with a lab member.

## **Small Picture**

* **Stay home if you’re sick**: Get well and don’t risk spreading it.
* **Notify if you’re out**: Let the lab manager or Hemanth know if you’re sick or on vacation. Update the lab calendar and your `Microsoft Teams` status.
* **No lab on staff holidays**: Unless you’re on a paid contract during university breaks.
* **Lock up**: Always lock the lab doors if you’re the last one to leave.
* **Keep it tidy**: Clean up food messes, take dirty dishes home, and keep common areas clutter-free.
* **Dress code**: Casual is fine, but look **semi-professional** when interacting with participants or presenting.
* **Arrive early**: Aim to be in the lab **15 minutes** before your experiments to greet participants.

## **Recourse**

If you feel your rights have been violated—or if you see others’ rights being compromised—it’s your duty to report it to a senior staff member (Hemanth, Department Chair, or even Title IX coordinator). **Don’t stay silent**—speak up and help maintain a healthy, respectful environment.
