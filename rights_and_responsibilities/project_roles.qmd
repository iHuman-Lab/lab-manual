# Lab Member Roles {.unnumbered}

Each lab member has a unique role, and we all bring our skills to the table. Here's who does what in iHuman Lab:

## PI (Principal Investigator)

The PI is the **brain behind the lab**—the one who keeps everything running:

* **Fundraising Genius**: Secures funding to keep the lab alive and thriving.
* **Research Coach**: Meets with you regularly (usually once a week) to discuss your projects and guide your academic journey.
* **Career Booster**: Helps you with professional development by connecting you with other researchers, writing recommendation letters, and promoting your work at conferences.
* **Human First**: Cares about you as a person, not just a researcher.

## Project Owner

The Project Owner is the **visionary**—the one who ensures the project is moving in the right direction and achieving results:

* **The Visionary**: Keeps the project’s big picture in mind and sets the research goals.
* **The Prioritizer**: Constantly adjusts the research priorities and long-term goals, including publication plans.
* **The Decision-Maker**: Makes final calls on project requirements, whether to publish, and whether to keep pushing forward with development.
* **The Guardian of Interests**: Considers funding bodies and the scientific community’s needs in every decision.
* **The Leader**: Guides the team but might still roll up their sleeves and contribute as a team member.

## Team Member

Team Members are the **engine** that powers the project. They do the hands-on work and collaborate closely:

* **Cross-functional All-Stars**: Write code, collect data, test software, proofread papers—whatever the project needs!
* **Self-Managing**: Organize and manage themselves, without needing a boss to tell them what to do.
* **Collaborative**: Work intensely with others in the team (think: constant communication, shared problem-solving).
* **Commitment**: Ideally, they focus on one project at a time and stay with the lab for the long haul.
* **Leadership**: Even as contributors, Team Members have a leadership role in driving their area of the project.

## Project Coordinator

The Project Coordinator is the **glue** that keeps everything together, making sure the team is staying on track and that the research process is smooth:

* **Impediment-Buster**: Helps remove any roadblocks that could slow down the team.
* **Environment Creator**: Ensures the team has the space and freedom to self-organize and thrive.
* **Data Guru**: Tracks progress and adjusts forecasts (you’ll see weekly updates in **Microsoft Teams**).
* **Team Shield**: Protects the team from distractions, so they can stay focused.
* **Timeline Enforcer**: Keeps an eye on deadlines and ensures the project stays on track.
* **No Authority**: The Project Coordinator has no formal management power over the team—they’re more like a helpful guide. (For now, that’s usually the Lab Coordinator or Hemanth).

## Collaborator

Collaborators are the **specialists** who offer occasional help but aren’t fully embedded in the project:

* **The Helper**: May provide data, equipment, consulting, feedback, minor analyses, or administrative support (like scheduling).
* **The Backstage Player**: They aren’t involved in day-to-day project decisions and generally don’t attend regular meetings.
* **Paper Recognition**: If their contribution is significant enough, they may be mentioned in acknowledgments, but usually **not** as co-authors.

Collaborators are a big help when needed, but they stay in the background unless they’re ready to step up into a bigger role.
