## Recourse
If you feel your rights as a lab member have been, or are in danger of being, violated, it is your duty to report those violations immediately to a senior staff member (e.g. Hemanth, Department Chair, Deans, police, Title IX coordinator, ombudsman, etc.). Similarly, if you notice others endangering othersâ€™ rights, or neglecting their responsibilities, it is your duty to report those violations to a senior staff member.
