# Lab meetings {.unnumbered}

Our lab has largely been operating in a *hybrid* mode of work (i.e., partially remote and partially in-person), and in recent years our meeting schedule and requirements have reflected this reality.

Moving forward, we are now gradually starting to incorporate more in-person interactions and meetings to facilitate more *spontaneous* interactions, discussions, and collaborations.

Effective lab communication requires forums for communicating. As described below, we use Slack to facilitate non-in-person communications. We also encourage in-person interactions as often as possible—ideally several times a week for group projects.

We’ll have the following regularly scheduled meetings:

Lab meetings. Starting in the winter, 2024 term, we will be re-instating weekly lab meetings, to be held on Tuesdays from 1:30 - 2:30 PM (CST) in our main lab space.

If you are an active lab member, you are expected to attend our lab meetings unless you let Hemanth know that you have a conflict (e.g., a course that meets at the same time, another commitment that comes up, etc.). It is important to prioritize
lab meeting attendance so that we can build and maintain a lab culture of collaboration and ongoing participation.

You are also expected to present at one lab meeting per term. Possible presentation topics include (but are not limited to):

* A half-baked idea you have
* An interesting paper you read
* An interesting tool or software package you learned about
* A tutorial
* A (brief) hackathon
* Something you’re confused about that you want help from other lab members
* A practice presentation (poster, talk, etc.) you’d like feedback on
* Lead a discussion about some topic you think would be of interest to the group

You can take up to an hour for your presentation or discussion, although taking less than an hour is great too. You can also share a meeting slot with one or more other lab members if you wish. (A presentation with another lab member can still “count” as a presentation for the given term.) Hemanth will send out a Google Sheets link where you can add yourself to the meeting schedule at the start of each term.
