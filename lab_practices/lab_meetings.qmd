# Lab Meetings 📅 {.unnumbered}

Our lab thrives on collaboration and communication—**lab meetings** are a core part of that! Whether we’re in-person or remote, we want to make sure there’s a space for everyone to share ideas, ask questions, and provide feedback. Here’s how we do it:

## Weekly Lab Meetings 🗓️

* **When**: Tuesdays from **1:30 - 2:30 PM (CST)**, starting in Fall 2025
* **Where**: ATRC 324
* **Attendance**: All active lab members should attend unless there’s a conflict (let Hemanth know if you can’t make it). These meetings are important for keeping the lab connected, informed, and collaborative.

## Presentation Expectations 🎤

* **Present once per term**: As an active member, you’ll present at least one lab meeting each term. It can be anything related to your work or something cool you’ve discovered!

Possible topics include:

* A **half-baked idea** or a topic you’re exploring
* A **paper** you found intriguing
* A tool or software package you learned about
* A **tutorial** or brief skill share
* A **hackathon** update or project progress
* Something you’re confused about—ask for feedback!
* **Practice presentations**: Talk or poster you’d like input on

You can take up to an hour, but shorter is fine! You can also co-present with a teammate if you like. Hemanth will send out a Google Sheets link for scheduling at the start of each term.

## Project Meetings 🤝

These are organized as needed for specific projects. Whether you're collaborating within the lab or with external partners, these meetings are all about **coordination and progress**.

* **Attendees**: Core project team + any interested lab members

## Hackathons 🖥️

We occasionally hold **hackathon-style events**—spontaneous, high-energy, short-term projects. These are a great way to tackle a specific problem or idea in a collaborative, fast-paced way.

* **Attendees**: Any interested lab members, Dartmouth community members, and external collaborators

## Weekly Snippets 📝

Each week, **all paid employees** must fill out a quick **weekly snippet** with answers to the following:

1. What did you work on last week?
2. What are you planning to work on this coming week?
3. Is anything blocking your progress?
4. Anything else you want to add?

This keeps everyone aligned and helps us understand where support might be needed.

# Bottom Line

Lab meetings are essential for keeping everyone in sync and fostering collaboration. Let’s keep the conversations flowing, ideas popping, and the energy high!
