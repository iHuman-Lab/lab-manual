# Scientific Integrity  {.unnumbered}

Scientific integrity is all about keeping our research **credible**, **transparent**, and **reproducible**. It’s the bedrock of everything we do in the lab! Here’s how we ensure that our work stands up to the highest standards.

## Reproducibility: The Holy Grail

* **Reproducible research** means that anyone, anywhere, should be able to reproduce your results if they follow the same process and use the same data.
* This requires **organization** and **meticulous documentation**—so be detailed in recording every step of your research journey!
* While **replicability** (getting the same result with a different dataset) is great, **reproducibility** is our minimum standard.

## Transparency & Openness

* **Open science**: Share your data so others can verify and build upon it.
* Publish in **accessible journals** and platforms to make your findings available to all.
* Be clear and detailed about your **methods** and **analytical approaches** so others can replicate or extend your work.

## Ethical Conduct: Be a Science Superhero

* Always ensure **informed consent** and protect **participants' privacy**.
* Report methods, results, and potential **conflicts of interest** openly and honestly.
* Follow **ethical guidelines** and field-specific **regulations**.

## Reproducibility & Rigor

* Keep **meticulous records**: from your methods and procedures to your data management.
* Validate findings through **independent replication** and robust **statistical analyses**.
* Double-check everything with **quality control** to minimize errors and biases.


# Bottom Line:

**Integrity is everything**. If we stay transparent, ethical, and rigorous in our approach, we’ll not only produce reliable findings but also earn the trust of the broader scientific community!
