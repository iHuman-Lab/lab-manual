## Reproducible research
Reproducible research is research that can be exactly reproduced. This is related to replicability, in that it has to do with your ability to get the same results again, but it refers specifically to getting the same results given the ​same set of data.​ I expect that all of our research will be, at minimum, reproducible (I hope that it will also be replicable).

Conducting reproducible research is more difficult than it sounds, because it requires that you are organized and possess sufficient foresight to document each step of your research process. There are two main things you can do to improve the reproducibility of your research: 1) extensive note-taking (i.e., as much as you can manage), 2) programming workflows with version control, and 3) extensive testing of code base and cross validation.

Programming workflows help with reproducibility because they take some of the human element out, and in an ideal scenario, you are left with a script or series of scripts that takes data from raw form to final product. Programming alone is not enough, though, because people can easily forget which script changes they made and when. Therefore, all projects that involve programming of any kind (so basically, all projects) must use some form of version control. I strongly recommend `git` in combination with `GitHub`, unless you have a pre-existing workflow. This is a hard requirement because

a) it is the only way to definitively track the evolution of methods/files over time
b) it allows for easier detection of bugs
c) it facilitates code sharing
d) it has nice side effects for workflow organization (e.g., thinking in terms of commits, branches, issues).

Points a, b, and c are directly relevant to the mission of conducting reproducible research.

## Experiment pre-analysis plans
You are encouraged to file a pre-analysis plan for any new study that you are beginning. I am flexible about the format of such a plan. Some trainees have opted to publish their pre-analysis plans on Open Science Framework. I do not require publishing these plans (except in particular circumstances that demand their use), but I do strongly encourage everyone to, at minimum, write one for your own personal reference. It is far too easy to forget what you planned to do at the start, before you saw any of the data, especially with EEG studies.
