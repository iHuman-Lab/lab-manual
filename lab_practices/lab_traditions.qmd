# Lab Traditions {.unnumbered}

We believe in celebrating the **milestones, achievements**, and **special moments** that make our time together in the lab unforgettable. Here are a few traditions we cherish:

## Celebrations with Donuts and More!

* **Sweet Moments**: Whether you've submitted a paper, won an award, or it's your birthday, we mark these milestones with **donuts for everyone**! It's our way of saying "great job" and sharing in your success.
* **Welcoming Newbies**: When new members join, Hemanth kicks things off with **donuts, coffee, or tea at 4pm** to make sure everyone feels at home from day one.

## Annual Lab Retreats

* **Bonding Beyond Science**: Every year, we take a retreat to a destination chosen by the whole lab. It's an opportunity to connect over science, **hike**, and **play board games**â€”but also just to have fun and relax together.

## Other Events

* We organize various other gatherings throughout the year, ensuring that **everyone feels included** and can participate in the fun! From team-building activities to social hangouts, thereâ€™s always something on the horizon.

Weâ€™re all about creating **memorable experiences** together, both inside and outside the lab. Letâ€™s make the most of our time together and celebrate the little wins along the way! ðŸŽ‰
