# Lab traditions {.unnumbered}

## Celebrations with donuts and more!
Here at our lab, we love to celebrate your milestones and special moments. Whether you've just submitted a paper, won an award, are leaving us, or it's your birthday, we believe in marking these occasions with donuts for everyone to enjoy. When new members join, Hemanth ensures we start off on a sweet note with donuts, coffee, and tea at 4pm.

## Annual lab retreats
We look forward to our annual lab retreats, where we get away to a destination chosen by all of us. It's a time to bond over science, enjoy hiking, and play board games together.

## Other events
In addition to retreats, we'll plan other events throughout the year. It's important to us that every lab member feels included and can participate in these gatherings.

We're excited to create memorable experiences together as a lab family!
