# Lab Practices & Policies {.unnumbered}

To achieve **scientific excellence** and a thriving lab, we stick to these guiding principles that keep things running smoothly and efficiently.

## Collaboration

* Weâ€™re all in this together. Our teamâ€™s **diversity**â€”from Computer Science to Neuroscienceâ€”helps us tackle tough problems.
* The key to success? **Admitting what we donâ€™t know** and **learning together**!

## Patience

* Science is hard. Expect experiments to fail more than succeedâ€”but thatâ€™s where the magic happens.
* **Stay calm, keep thinking, and collaborate** when things go wrong. If somethingâ€™s not working, itâ€™s okay to **move on**.

## Accept the Process

* Mistakes and **unexpected results** happen. Embrace them.
* Facing issues head-on, figuring them out, and moving forward is the only way to grow!

## Caution

* **Skepticism is key**. Double-check everything.
* Test your results from every angle to ensure youâ€™re on the right track.

## Attention to Detail

* Small details can make or break an experiment.
* Quality control is **crucial** to ensure things keep moving forward smoothly.

## Communication

* No one works alone here. Good communication keeps us **on the same page**.
* **Frequent updates** help avoid misunderstandings and duplicated efforts.

## Feedback

* Constructive **criticism** is **essential**. Itâ€™s not personalâ€”just a way to improve!
* Our goal is to **find solutions**, not prove how clever we are. **Feedback fuels better science**.

## Positivity

* Science is tough, but a **positive attitude** keeps the team energized.
* If youâ€™re having a hard time staying upbeat, letâ€™s talkâ€”itâ€™s all about supporting each other!

## Balance

* Donâ€™t burn out. Work smarter, not harder!
* **Focus blocks** and breaks will help you stay **productive** and **refreshed**.

## Resource Allocation

* Our resources (time, money, equipment) are limited.
* Letâ€™s use them wisely to make the biggest impact. And always be on the lookout for **funding opportunities**!
