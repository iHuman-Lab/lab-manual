# Travel Policy {.unnumbered}

A huge part of doing research is **communicating your findings** with others. Our lab frequently presents at **international conferences**, and we want to support you in getting your work out there. Here’s how we handle travel for these events:

## If You’re Presenting Your Work

* **Travel Expenses & Conference Fees**: If you’re the presenting author (talk or poster), the lab will **cover your travel expenses** and **conference registration fees**.
* **Seek Other Funding**: We encourage you to seek additional travel funding through other channels (e.g., PBS, internal Dartmouth sources, travel awards, personal grants like NRSAs or NSF fellowships).
* **Keep It Reasonable**: While we want to be mindful of your comfort and time, **keep costs low**. This might mean flying economy, finding affordable hotels, and sharing rooms with lab members when possible. We'll still ensure you’re comfortable!

## If You’re a Senior Lab Member (Not Presenting)

* **Limited Support**: If you’re not presenting but are a senior member (e.g., postdoc), the lab may cover your travel expenses to **a limited number of conferences each year**.
* **Discuss with Hemanth**: Please talk to Hemanth about which conferences you’re interested in attending and whether funding is possible.

## If You’re a Junior Lab Member (Not Presenting)

* **Funding Not Typically Provided**: If you’re not presenting and you’re a junior member (e.g., undergrad or early-stage grad student), the lab typically does not cover travel expenses.
* **Explore Funding Options**: If you really want to attend a conference, try to find external funding. If you can’t secure any, **talk to Hemanth** to explore your options.

# Bottom Line:

**Presenting your work**? The lab’s got you covered. Not presenting? You may still have opportunities, but it’ll need a conversation with Hemanth. We want to support your growth and help you get to those big conferences! 🌍
