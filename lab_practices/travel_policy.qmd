# Travel policy {.unnumbered}

A major component of doing scientific research is communicating with other scientists. The iHuman Lab regularly presents at several international scientific conferences. If you are presenting your work from the lab (i.e., you are the presenting author for a talk or poster), then your travel expenses and conference registration fees will be guaranteed by the lab, under the assumption that you will also make reasonable efforts to seek out alternative sources of travel funding (e.g. through PBS, other internal Dartmouth sources, applying for travel awards, using personal grants like NRSAs or NSF fellowships, etc.). You are also expected to keep costs low (e.g. fly economy class, seek out cheaper tickets, stay in reasonably priced hotels, share a room with other lab members, etc.). By the same token, we also want to be cognizant of your comfort and time, and it is not always necessary to use the cheapest option. More specific travel guidelines will be given on a per-conference or per-trip basis.

If you are not presenting your work (or if you’re presenting non-lab work), but you are a senior lab member, then the lab may cover your travel expenses to a limited number of conferences each year. These should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with Hemanth.

If you are a junior lab member not presenting your work, the lab will generally not pay for you to attend conferences. However, if you are interested in attending a conference, and you aren’t able to secure funding through non-lab sources, you should discuss your options with Hemanth.
