# Deadlines ⏳ {.unnumbered}

Staying sane in academia is all about teamwork and timing! Think of deadlines as stormy seas—your job is to spot the lighthouse early and signal the crew (yes, even bug Hemanth). Clear heads and timely nudges keep the ship sailing smoothly. Here are the ideal timelines:

* **Quick stuff** (conference reviews, paperwork): 1 week’s notice.
* **Medium stuff** (recommendation letters): 2 weeks.
* **Big stuff** (research/teaching statements): 3 weeks.
* **Manuscripts**: Share drafts ASAP! If feedback stalls past 2 weeks, a friendly reminder works wonders.
