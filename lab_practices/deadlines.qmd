# Deadlines {.unnumbered}

Maintaining sanity in academia is a fine art, and organization is your best-friend! It's not just about keeping your own ship sailing smoothly; it's about ensuring everyone in your academic crew stays on course. When deadlines loom, be the lighthouse: as soon as you know a deadline, signal your collaborators and keep them informed as the date approaches. And yes, even bug Hemanth if you mustâ€”after all, timely reminders keep the research ship afloat and cruising toward success!

- For time-sensitive tasks like reviewing conference abstracts or completing paperwork, give Hemanth at least one week's notice. This allows him to approach the task promptly and deliver results without unnecessary rush.

- Projects requiring moderate effort, such as crafting letters of recommendation, benefit from a bit more lead time. Providing Hemanth with at least two weeks ensures he can dedicate the necessary attention to detail.

- When collaborating on research and teaching statements, a minimum of three weeks allows for productive discussions and ensures the final product reflects thorough consideration and expertise.

- For manuscripts, pivotal to academic contributions, share drafts as soon as they're ready. If a response is delayed beyond two weeks, a gentle reminder ensures timely feedback, contributing to a seamless publication process.
