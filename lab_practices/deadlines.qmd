# Deadlines {.unnumbered}

One way of maintaining sanity in the academic world is to be as organized as possible. This is essential because disorganization does not just hurt you; it hurts your collaborators and the people who need help. When it comes to deadlines, tell your collaborators as soon as you know when a deadline is, and make sure they are aware of it the closer it gets. Do not be afraid to bug them about it (yes, bug Hemanth as well).

- Give Hemanth at least one week’s notice to do something with a hard deadline that does not require a lot of time (e.g., reading/commenting on conference abstracts, filling out paperwork, etc.).
- Give Hemanth at least two weeks’ notice (preferably more)to do something with a hard deadline that requires a moderate amount of time (e.g., a letter of recommendation).
- If you want feedback on research and teaching statements or other work that requires multiple back-and-forth interactions between you and Hemanth before a hard deadline, give him as much time as you can, at the very least three weeks. For manuscript submissions and revisions (i.e., which either have no deadline at all or only a weak deadline), send drafts to Hemanth as soon as you have them, and bug him to give you feedback if he has not responded in two weeks – papers are important!
