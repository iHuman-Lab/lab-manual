# Lab attendance {.unnumbered}

At iHuman Lab, we value each member as an integral part of our research community. Our lab thrives on collaboration, dedication, and mutual respect. To ensure our collective success and the smooth operation of our research endeavors, we have established the following guidelines regarding absences:

**Attendance Expectations:** Your presence is crucial to the progress of our research projects. Please make every effort to attend all scheduled lab sessions, meetings, experiments, and other research activities as outlined by Hemanth.

**Reporting Absences:** Life happens, and if you're unable to attend a scheduled lab session or meeting due to illness, personal emergency, or any unforeseen circumstances, please notify Hemanth as soon as possible. Your early communication helps us adjust plans accordingly and supports a smooth workflow for everyone.

**Scheduling Adjustments:** We believe in flexibility where possible. Depending on your circumstances and the nature of our projects, we'll do our best to accommodate your needs or adjust timelines with your input and agreement.

**Exceptions and Special Cases:** We understand that life can present challenges beyond our control. If you're facing prolonged illness, family emergencies, or any exceptional circumstances, please reach out to Hemanth to best support you during this time.

This policy reflects our commitment to maintaining a supportive and inclusive research environment. We review it regularly to ensure it aligns with our shared goals and values as a lab community. Remember, your dedication and contributions are what make our research lab thrive. Thank you for being an essential part of our team.
