# Lab Attendance 🧑‍🔬 {.unnumbered}

At **iHuman Lab**, we’re a team that thrives on **collaboration, dedication, and respect**. Your presence is essential to keep everything running smoothly and moving forward. Here’s what you need to know about attendance:

## Attendance Expectations 🕒

* **Be Present**: We value your contributions and the collaborative nature of our work. Try to attend all **scheduled lab sessions, meetings, and experiments** as planned by Hemanth.
* **Team Effort**: Each member’s attendance is important for the collective success of our research projects!

## Reporting Absences 📱

* **Life Happens**: We get it—sometimes things come up. If you can’t make a session or meeting due to illness, an emergency, or something unexpected, **let Hemanth know ASAP**.
* **Early Communication**: The earlier we know, the easier it is to adjust plans and keep everything on track.

## Scheduling Flexibility 🤸‍♂️

* **We’re Flexible**: If you have a valid reason for needing a schedule adjustment, we’ll work with you to accommodate your situation while keeping our research on track.

## Special Circumstances ❤️

* **Support During Hard Times**: If you’re facing **prolonged illness** or a **family emergency**, reach out to Hemanth. We’ll figure out how to best support you during tough times.
