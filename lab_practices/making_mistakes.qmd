# Making mistakes {.unnumbered}

The work we do is complicated, and mistakes happen. When you notice a mistake (a bug, misinterpretation, mislabeling, or any other error), it is critical that you report the mistake immediately. Whereas mistakes are unavoidable in science, negative impacts can be minimized by fostering a workplace where reporting mistakes is celebrated and accepted as part of the natural course of getting things done. Mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow, and identifying or noticing mistakes should be celebrated as part of our growth as scientists. However, real harm can come from failing to report mistakes soon enough. There is a proverb that says *the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago; the second best time is now.* Analogously, `the best time to identify and correct a mistake may have been in the past– but the second best time is right now!`

Example scenarios (not an exhaustive list):

1. You’ve shared a figure, statistic, or other result, and you’ve realized there’s a bug in your code.
2. You tried to collect some data and the experiment crashed or yielded corrupted data.
3. You’re re-reading a paper that you shared, and you notice a mistake or typo.
4. You made a plan with your project team and you realized it’s flawed in some way, or that there’s potentially a better solution or approach.
5. You released a software package and you’ve found a bug or error.

Appropriate actions for each of the above scenarios (this should happen immediately after you notice the mistake):

1. Double check, to the best of your ability, that the mistake is real. This may involve checking over code, rebooting a computer and restarting an experiment, re-reading reference text, etc.
2. Create a GitHub issue describing the problem. Provide information about how to reproduce the problem (if applicable), the expected behavior, and the observed behavior. Also, provide any relevant system or environment information that may be necessary for reproducing the problem (e.g. details of the computing environment).
3. Coordinate over Slack with your project team to formulate an action plan.
4. Ask other lab members for help if the course of action isn’t clear. Also, try Google and/or Stack Exchange.
If you think you might have caught a mistake but aren’t sure, consult with another lab member! It never hurts to be safe!
