# Making Mistakes {.unnumbered}

Mistakes happen. In science, they’re part of the process! But how we handle them can make or break our research. The key is **facing mistakes head-on** and **learning from them**—because that’s how we improve.

## Why It's OK to Make Mistakes (But Important to Report)

* Mistakes are unavoidable, and they don’t mean failure—they're **opportunities to learn**.
* Reporting them **immediately** minimizes the impact and helps us correct course early.
* Think of it like this: **“The best time to fix a mistake was earlier, the second best time is now!”**

## Example Scenarios (and how to handle them)

1. **You found a bug in your code after sharing a figure/statistic**

   * **Verify**: Double-check the code and results.
   * **Report**: Create a GitHub issue with all the details.
   * **Collaborate**: Let the team know so you can fix it together.

2. **The experiment crashed or corrupted data**

   * **Verify**: Check if the data is salvageable or if a redo is needed.
   * **Report**: Document the issue so the team knows and can avoid it next time.
   * **Collaborate**: Discuss with others on **Microsoft Teams** to troubleshoot.

3. **You found a typo in a paper you’ve shared**

   * **Verify**: Reread the document and confirm the error.
   * **Report**: If it’s minor, just correct and update the file.
   * **Collaborate**: Ask for a second pair of eyes from the team for a more thorough review.

4. **Your project plan has a flaw or needs improvement**

   * **Verify**: Review the plan and identify any improvements.
   * **Report**: Discuss changes with the team and update the plan.
   * **Collaborate**: Share new ideas and work together to improve the approach.

5. **You released a software package with an error**

   * **Verify**: Reproduce the issue and assess the extent.
   * **Report**: Post the error on GitHub and document the bug.
   * **Collaborate**: Work with the team to fix it and release a patch.

## The Action Steps: What to Do Immediately

1. **Verify**: Confirm the mistake before jumping to conclusions.
2. **Report**: Use GitHub or other tools to document the error.
3. **Collaborate**: Talk with the team on **Microsoft Teams** to brainstorm solutions.
4. **Seek Guidance**: Don’t be afraid to ask for help—sometimes the best ideas come from others.

Mistakes are part of **being a researcher**, so **let's celebrate them** as learning moments. By fostering an environment of **open communication**, **collaboration**, and **growth**, we ensure our work is always improving. ✨
