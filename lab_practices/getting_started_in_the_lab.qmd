# Getting started in the lab {.unnumbered}

The very first thing you need to do is to get set up on the following platforms, which will enable you to interact with the rest of the lab, download and use the lab’s software packages, and accomplish various necessary administrative tasks:

1. **``Slack``**: This is where almost all not-in-person lab communications take place. It provides an interface for asking questions, storing notes, and sharing ideas. Here are some tutorials to get started with Slack:

2. **``GitHub``**: This is used to manage all code, papers, grants, presentations, and posters. In other words, anything where it’d be useful to track multiple versions, anything that we might ultimately want to release to the public, and/or anything that multiple lab members will be collaborating on. Each project has one or more `GitHub` repositories. You should treat `GitHub` as a digital version of a “lab notebook” that contains a formal record of every contribution you make to your projects. We use `GitHub` logs to assign credit for ideas, code or writing contributions, determine authorship order, and more. It is therefore critical that you regularly check in (commit) your work via `GitHub` so that you receive appropriate credit for your ideas and maintain a continuous traceable log for your project. Here are some tutorials to get started with GitHub:

3. **``ClickUp``**: This serves as our essential management tool for meticulously tracking project progress and priorities. Leveraging the [Kanban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAw-sUQwMSk){target='_blank_'} method extensively, we visualize our workflows dynamically. This allows us to categorize tasks into clear stages, from planning and experimentation to analysis and publication. By visualizing our project in this manner, we can easily identify bottlenecks, prioritize tasks, and decide which parts of the project to focus on at any given time. Here are some tutorials to get started with ClickUp:

:::{.callout-note title=Task}
Create (free) individual `ClickUp`, `Slack`, and `GitHub` accounts. Once you create the account(s) send a request to Hemanth via [ihuman.research.lab@gmail.com]() along with the respective email addresses used `ClickUp`, `Slack`, and `GitHub` to add you the lab's account.
:::

Once you’ve created those accounts, you can ask any questions through `Slack` (use the #general channel or the channel specific your project). Depending on your role in the lab, you may be added on `Slack` as a single-channel guest (access to only one channel) or a in the #general channel through the Workflows menu (usually near the top left of the window). Once you initiate the workflow, you’ll be guided through the onboarding process.

## Lab website {#sec-labwebsite}
Once you have your accounts set up, you’ll need to add your profile to the lab’s website. Follow these steps to fork the repository, create your profile folder, and add your details.

### Step 1: Fork the Lab Website Repository

1. Go to the [lab website GitHub repository](https://github.com/iHuman-Lab/lab-website){target='_blank_'}.
2. Click on the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

### Step 2: Clone Your Forked Repository

1. On your GitHub account, navigate to your forked repository.
2. Click the **Code** button and copy the repository URL.
3. Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   ```
4. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd lab-website
   ```

### Step 3: Add Your Profile Folder

1. In the `people` directory, find the folder corresponding to your role in the lab:

   ```{.bash}
   people/
   ├── pi/
   ├── phd/
   ├── master/
   ├── undergraduate/
   └── alumni/
   ```

2. If you are a `master` student, create a new folder with your name under the `master` directory. Replace `"your_name"` with your actual name:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p people/master/"your_name"
   ```

   For other roles, replace `master` with `pi`, `phd`, `undergraduate`, or `alumni` accordingly.

### Step 4: Add Your Profile Details

1. Inside your folder (e.g., `people/master/"your_name"`), add your profile photo and index file.

2. Your photo should be named `avatar.jpg`. Add this photo to your folder:
   ```bash
   cp path/to/your/photo.jpg people/master/"your_name"/avatar.jpg
   ```

3. Create an `index.qmd` file in the same folder. Use the following content template for `index.qmd`:

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: Your name here
   about:
       template: trestles
       links:
           - icon: linkedin
             text: LinkedIn
             url: Add your linkedin link
           - icon: github
             text: Github
             url: Add your Github link
           - text: "{{< ai google-scholar >}} Google Scholar"
             url: Add your Google Scholar link. If it is not available, leave blank
           - text: Website
             url: Add your Website link. If it is not available, leave blank
   image: ./avatar.jpg
   ---

   ## Education
   Fill your education history here

   ## Research Interest
   Provide your research interest
   ```

   Replace placeholders like `Your name here`, `Add your linkedin link`, etc., with your actual details.

### Step 5: Commit and Push Your Changes

1. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add profile for [Your Name]"
   ```

2. Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 6: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Pull Requests** tab and then **New Pull Request**.
3. Select the base repository as `iHuman-Lab/lab-website` and compare it with your forked repository.
4. Add a description for your pull request and submit it.

Congratulations! You’ve added your profile to the lab website. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to the Hemanth for help.
