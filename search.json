This doesn’t mean you need to do the same thing every day (each project has many components and, as described above, the focus of lab projects will change over time), but it gives some sense of how you should be allocating your work time.\nIf you are a part-time employee of the lab, prior experience has shown that you will most likely be able to make a meaningful contribution to only a single project at a time. If you are a full-time employee, you may choose to devote some of your time to a secondary project (with the understanding that you will always prioritize your primary project).
