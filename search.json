This manual is to help you make the transition into iHuman lab more enjoyable.\nThis lab manual is crafted as your essential companion, designed to acquaint you with our lab’s operations, policies, and your rights and responsibilities as a valued member of the lab. Within these pages, you will find detailed explanations of the bill of rights and responsibilities, outlining both what you can expect from the lab environment and what is expected of you in terms of conduct, safety, and ethical standards. Clear and concise lab practices and policies are also delineated to ensure smooth integration into our research workflows.",

All lab members are welcome (and encouraged!) to submit edits that improve the content, clarity, and overall helpfulness of this document at any point throughout their tenure in the lab. What should you do if you don’t understand something? If you don’t understand something you read in this manual, it is important that you ask another lab member for help. Every member of the lab brings their own unique knowledge base, training, life experiences, and perspectives. Respecting and celebrating those differences drives the science we do. If you’re new to the lab or new to a particular technique, you might feel like a newbie today—but chances are good that if you stick around for a bit someone else will be seeking your expert opinion before you know it. In addition to learning, there’s another good reason for asking for help: if you don’t understand something, there’s a reasonable chance that you’ve discovered a mistake or a logical inconsistency!",

    "text": "The work we do is complicated, and mistakes happen. When you notice a mistake (a bug, misinterpretation, mislabeling, or any other error), it is critical that you report the mistake immediately. Whereas mistakes are unavoidable in science, negative impacts can be minimized by fostering a workplace where reporting mistakes is celebrated and accepted as part of the natural course of getting things done. Mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow, and identifying or noticing mistakes should be celebrated as part of our growth as scientists. However, real harm can come from failing to report mistakes soon enough. There is a proverb that says the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago; the second best time is now. Analogously, the best time to identify and correct a mistake may have been in the past– but the second best time is right now!\nExample scenarios (not an exhaustive list):\n\nYou’ve shared a figure, statistic, or other result, and you’ve realized there’s a bug in your code.\nYou tried to collect some data and the experiment crashed or yielded corrupted data.\nYou’re re-reading a paper that you shared, and you notice a mistake or typo.\nYou made a plan with your project team and you realized it’s flawed in some way, or that there’s potentially a better solution or approach.\nYou released a software package and you’ve found a bug or error.\n\nAppropriate actions for each of the above scenarios (this should happen immediately after you notice the mistake):\n\nDouble check, to the best of your ability, that the mistake is real. This may involve checking over code, rebooting a computer and restarting an experiment, re-reading reference text, etc.\nCreate a GitHub issue describing the problem. Provide information about how to reproduce the problem (if applicable), the expected behavior, and the observed behavior. Also, provide any relevant system or environment information that may be necessary for reproducing the problem (e.g. details of the computing environment).\nCoordinate over Slack with your project team to formulate an action plan.\nAsk other lab members for help if the course of action isn’t clear. Also, try Google and/or Stack Exchange. If you think you might have caught a mistake but aren’t sure, consult with another lab member! It never hurts to be safe!",
